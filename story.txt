“Student Orientation: Welcome to Georgia Tech, where the only extracurricular activity is stealing the T's off of campus. Starting with: stealing the dual T's from Fitten hall! It's your time to shine!”
Successful mission at Fi--en Hall! Now off to West Village!
Way to go! Time to head up the hill to Stamps Health Services where 2 T's are waiting!
Score! Moving over to the Instructional Center (so many T's!)
Incredible work at the Ins-ruc-ional Cen-er! Now across the way to the Exhibition Hall!
Perfection. And on to the Student Center (maybe there's time to grab some food before tackling all those T's...)
Scrumptious! Time for the best building on campus, the College of Computing!
Wonderful as always! Let's go check out the Russ Chandler Stadium (maybe everyone will be distracted with baseball...)
Easy peasy! Why not stop by Peters Parking Deck on the way.
Fantastic! Let's take a quick break at North Avenue Dining (there might more of interest to us than just food there...)
Yay! While we're in the area might as well hang out in the North Avenue Apartments, just to visit some friends, no other reason...
Excellent work! Ooh let's see what's going on in Bobby Dodd Stadium, I'm sure Buzz would love to hear about our adventures.
You've made it to the biggest challenge yet: stealing the T from Tech Tower. Good luck!
Congratula-ions!!! You've gone where even George P. Burdell failed. You migh- no- be able to gradua-e wi-h a Georgia -ech degree now bu- you will always be an honorary T-Clicker.
